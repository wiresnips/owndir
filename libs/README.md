I'm not sure what the correct way to handle satellite dependencies is. (In a perfect world, other people would also write things like this, and I would link them? I dunno, that's kinda the point).

But, a bunch of these are getting written by *me*, and I don't want to wrangle like ten different repos of whatever, so for now they'll just live here, and probably be referred to directly.
