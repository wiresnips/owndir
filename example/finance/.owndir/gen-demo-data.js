  Look, I'm building the framework alongside my own _application_ of it
  which means I can give at least one example of how to use it fairly 
  easily, but also that example depends on my own data

  So, here's me faking up some data, because fuck posting the real shit

  I've lazily scrubbed out the most obvious fingerprints, but if you work at it,
  you could probably still dox me. Please don't. I would rather you not.
  Seriously, you can just email me, it's probably a lot less work.
