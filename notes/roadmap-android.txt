Thread Management
=================

  I don't know how to actually _stop_ a nodejs process, short of bringing down the entire NodeService
  That seems a little odd, doesn't it? There should be a way to do that ...

  Apparently, I can spin off whole new processes, if I want to ...
      ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder("path/to/your/native/executable", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3");
      Process nativeProcess = processBuilder.start();

  this is ... less than ideal. It might work, but it would require me to entirely disassemble my JNI machinery ...

  











Architectures
=============

  circle back to this now 
    - I had some very basic errors in build-node.sh that have been resolved 
    - other architectures might come online, now they're fixed

  there are multiple places in my build chain that only support arm64
    build-node.sh - I can't build node except for arm64
    build.gradle - installOwnDirServerDeps has a hardcoded arm64

  what do I even _do_ with the output of that? I guess that would be multiple APKs?
    this is going to require a more sophisticated build chain than I am currently interested in building
    also, I wouldn't have a way of testing it, even if it appeared to work



Binaries and Install Scripts
============================

  WITHOUT ROOT, I CANNOT MAKE BINARIES EXECUTABLE
    anything that relies on external binaries is toast
    anything that shells out during a pre/post install script, is toast
