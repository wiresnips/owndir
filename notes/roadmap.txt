Permissions
===========

	currently, these are stubbed



File Change Events
==================

	these are just kinda fuckey no matter how I slice it
		REALLY not happy with the handwave I have in the direction of listeners

	needs a built-in client-side solution






Loose Ends
==========

	hardcoded client.js path

	solution to bundling fsNode_client.js
		once I get around to experimenting with a plugin-distribution mechanism, 
		maybe this will get folded into that?

	there might be some shenanigans WRT windows vs posix paths, ie foo/bar/baz vs foo\bar\baz
		because a lot of this shit runs server-side AND client-side, consider normalizing paths to posix
		this might entail replacing `require('path')` with `require('path').posix` everywhere


how to deal with static assets?
===============================

	I want some easy way for plugins to declare, and then make use of, static assets
	whadaya wanna bet this flows through FsNode somehow?


crashes and failed compilation
==============================

	I must be able to detect these, right?

	Maybe I need to start fucking around with Babel directly
	


plugin distribution mechanism
=============================
	a postinstall script that moves the plugin from node_modules up a level

	then, you can `npm install @homestead/fancy-plugin`, and it'll just work, I think ...

	can I get this working cross-platform?
		the way to do this is, to use javascript instead of bash

		so, let's imagine a package, @homestead/plugin-utils
		plugins can require it, and it will provide a postinstall.js script

		then, in package.json, you have this:
			"postinstall": "node node_modules/homestead-plugin-utils/postinstall.js my-plugin"



Android?
========



HTML diff and patch for SSR bundles
===================================

	this seems like it should be a solved problem, right?
	there must be some existing solution to merge a DOM node into an existing DOM node

	checkout jQuery.load(), this is like 90% of what I care about
	and it's deliciously braindead
