Plugins

	how do they work?
		function takes and returns a module, stack that shit like middleware

		Have to be careful to return the SAME object, otherwise we could break the prototype chain

			Or, maybe just don't use the return value, to be safe


	how are they INCORPORATED ?

		- need to relate them to the build

		- need to require and run them in `index.js`




Client-side code

	how the fuck do I want to do THIS?

	Seems like the kinda thing that ought to live in a plugin, but it'll need support from Build



Build Plugins

	I want to be able to write modules in clojurescript. 

	Some other jerks probably want to do it in typescript or whatever.

	Bring-your-own-compiler seems necessary





Remote Access

	Actually, I think that we don't _need_ remote access 
		just run this out of a dropbox folder and put up a local server

		Or a fuckin' git repo, who cares

		Point is, I don't have to fuck around with making ONE server public, I can just use existing filesync tools for distribution
