here's the central conceit of a webRTC connection


server -> render an html page, which is saved down to the .owndir

outside -> load the html page, which forms a webRTC connection to the server (?) or else a relay _browser_ (? that seems dumb, why not the server directly)
  
  server-only candidates:

    https://github.com/shinyoshiaki/werift-webrtc


okay, so if we're going straight from the server, that simplifies some things ...

I still think we should iron over the wrinkle of where the html comes from though




okay, here's something to notice: 
  I'm serving a lot of static content

  this make ssense, but it ALSO means that I can't just write interface_wrtc.js and be done with it

  fuck

  well ... local files CAN be accessed by simple html files, right?

  soo .... what I would need, would be to detect that and bounce it back ... if I wanted to be fully automatic

  that sounds like a LOT of trouble, probably another dollop of convention is the answer here, right?


yeah, I feel like when this is actually done, I'll have learned that I can go a LOT farther by making strong iniial conventions
  the fact that you can bring your own build, and potentially go all-static is not that _interesting_ to me, I specifically want that semi-realtime reactivity



AND, I think this is relevant here because I'm kinda rolling up to a point where I need to add more _convention_ anyways ....
so, let's think about what we want to base in
