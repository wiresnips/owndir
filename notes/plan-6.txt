Alright, let's think about PLUGINS


First thought, plugins are functions that transform modules


	function plugin (_module) {
		// this isn't how middleware works (yet), but you get the idea
		_module['.central'].middleware.push((req) => {

		})

		return _module
	}


Which certainly seems like it would be powerful enough
